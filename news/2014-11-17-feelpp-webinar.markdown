*Anisotropic mesh adaptation and stabilized finite elements method for solving conjugate heat transfers and turbulent flows*

Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) describes a wide variety of industrial problems arising in mechanical
engineering, civil engineering and biomechanics. In spite of the available computer performance and the
actual maturity of computational fluid dynamics and computational structural dynamics, several key
issues still prevent accurate FSI simulations.

Two main approaches for the simulation of FSI problems are still gaining attention lately: partitioned and
monolithic approaches. Results in the literature show that the partitioned approach is accurate and
efficient but some instabilities may occur depending on the ratio of the densities and the complexity of
the geometry. Monolithic methods are still of interest due to their capability to treat the interaction of
the fluid and the structure using a unified formulation. In fact it makes the buildup of a FSI problem
easier as the mesh do not have to fit the geometry of the solids and the transfers are treated naturally.

The software Thost has been created based on these analyzes. Thost is a 3D aerothermal numerical
software. It has been developed for the numerical simulation of industrial processes like the heating in
industrial furnaces as well as quenching. Its target is to model numerically the thermal history of the
industrial pieces in their environment without using any transfer coefficient. However the computational
costs are still high and therefore the software is not fully efficient from an industrial point of view to
simulate, analyze and improve complex processes. All the work in this PhD thesis has been done to
reduce the computational costs and optimize the accuracy of the simulations in Thost based on
innovative numerical methods such as dynamic anisotropic mesh adaptation, stabilized finite elements
methods and immersing the objects directly from their Computer Aided Design files.
