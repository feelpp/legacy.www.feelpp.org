Over the past few decades, the computational fluid dynamics has evolved to become an important tool for the description of the complex multi-physics, multi-scale phenomena characterizing blood flow. Its reliability depends both on the verification of the numerical methods and on the validation of the mathematical models. The aim of the this talk is to first, present a preconditioning framework for the linear system arising from the finite element discretizations and time advancing finite difference schemes of the 3D steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we are interested in comparing the performance of three preconditioners based on an algebraic factorization of the systemâ€™s matrix which exploit its block structure, the PCD preconditioner , the SIMPLE preconditioner or the LSC preconditioner, see [Elman et al. (2014)]. The second goal of this talk is to describe a framework for the solution of flow problems relevant to biomechanics strongly supported by the aforementioned solving strategies and assess its efficiency through a validation with respect to experimental data. [Stewart et al. (2012)].
