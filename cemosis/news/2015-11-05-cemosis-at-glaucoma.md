Cemosis was at the [International Congress of Advanced Technologies and Glaucoma Treatments](http://www.glaucomacongress.com/).

Dr. Marcela Szopos [has presented](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01225853v1) at the [International Congress of Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Glaucoma](www.glaucomacongress.com/) our research work to highlight with a mathematical model the interaction between the elevated intraocular pressure and the blood pressure.

Pr. Christophe Prud'homme [has presented](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/CEMOSIS/hal-01223120v1) the platform AngioTK to bridge the gap from medical imaging to numerical simulations.
