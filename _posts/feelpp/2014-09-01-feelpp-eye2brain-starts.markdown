Thanks to the funding of the Labex IRMIA (Universit√© de Strasbourg)
and the University of Indiana Purdue University (IUPIU), we have the
pleasure to welcome Pr. Giovanna Guidoboni in our research group for
the next 2 years. The research project is call *Eye2Brain: the eye as
a window to the brain*.  The main goal of the proposed research is to
develop mathematical models that describe the mechanics and
hemodynamics of the eye, the brain and the relationship between the
two.

This project is a collaboration between Giovanna
Guidoboni(UIPIU/IRMIA), Marcela Szopos and Christophe Prud'homme
(Cemosis).
