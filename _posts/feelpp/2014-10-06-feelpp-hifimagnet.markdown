C. Daversin will present the advances of the HiFiMagnet (High Field
MAgnet) project. She will cover theoretical aspects and the numerical
methods necessary to solve the multi-physics problem (magnetostatic,
electrostatic, thermal and mechanical) associated to the simulation of
high field magnet (about 36T).

This work is a collaboration between [Cemosis](http://www.cemosis.fr) and [LNCMI](http://www.lncmi.cnrs.fr).
