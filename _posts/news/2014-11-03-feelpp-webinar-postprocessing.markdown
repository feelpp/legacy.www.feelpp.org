A. Ancel ([Cemosis](http://www.cemosis.fr)) will present the advances in some of the post-processing tools
in Feel++:

  - Data formats including parallel data format

  - Exporters and things that you need to know about them

  - Performances

Recently improvments to the Feel++ exporter classes have brought
better EnsightGold and Gmsh support (merge of parallel data files) and
support to XDMF(HDF5+XML).  A. Ancel will present a performance study
of these exporters.

The [webinar](https://plus.google.com/events/cghbgfrm19n0u0q4dai9qmfu2a4?authkey=CLz_9LrAy5OSQw) will be done using this
[hangout](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/event/cfi968baq5r67sqrgrtnjpljq3c?authuser=2&eid=105887650279494070342&hl=fr).
