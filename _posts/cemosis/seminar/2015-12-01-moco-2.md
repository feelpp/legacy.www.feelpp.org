Applying numerical and mathematical methods to industrial problems
involves dealing with some difficult issues : complex physical
behaviors, numerical stability, the choice of efficient solving
strategies. Moreover, in the case of aerothermal simulations, a direct
resolution is impossible in most of industrial applications, because
of the enormous computational resources that would be necessary, and
so you often have to consider averaged equations and find an
appropriate turbulence model. In this talk, we will present you an
aerothermal simulation framework implemented with the finite element
C++ librairy, Feel++. We will particularly describe our temporal
scheme using an adaptive time step algorithm and the different
stabilizations methods we develop to tackle the numerical instability
issues. This results are parts of a thesis work which aims to develop
a reduced order model for aerothermal turbulent simulations.
